# Gamma

## What is gamma
Gamma is a super simple raytracing library for roblox made with lua.

## how does it work
This public version only has one function, **Raylib.Cast.Simple(MaxBounces, Origin, Direction)**.
The function returns a table containing raydata. Raydata = {Pos, Col, Ins, Nor, Mat, Num, Dis}.
Raylib handles the math and raycasting.

## What can I use it for?
Many of my premium systems (Like the soon to be for sale TPGI system) utilize versions of this
library since It is fast, light and powerful. So much so that it can be used fo realtime calculations.
